If you are working at CSE, explode the <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/19T2//activities/js_counter/counter.zip">zip file</a> containing the files for this activity:

<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">unzip /web/cs2041/19T2/activities/js_counter/counter.zip</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
If you are working on your computer, download <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/19T2//activities/js_counter/counter.zip">counter.zip</a> and unzip it .
</p>

Then in one window use Python to start a HTTP server for the exercises

<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">cd counter</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">python3 -m http.server</kbd>
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
</pre>

If you access the URL printed by Python you will see instructions for the exercise.
<p>
Remember to refresh the web page in your browser (<code>control-R</code> inchrome and firefox)
when you make a change to the Javascript so it gets loaded.
You can stop the server by pressing <code> control-c </code>
</p><p>

    


You do not change <b>index.html</b> but you should read its source:

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">cd counter</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">more index.html</kbd>
</pre>

Notice  <b>index.html</b> loads  <b>counter.js</b>.  You need to edit  <b>counter.js</b>
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">vi counter.js</kbd>
</pre>

Your task is to add JavaScript to <b>counter.js</b> so that the current time is shown on the web page.
<p>
Your Javascript should put the current time in the <b>output</b> div.
</p><p>
The time should be updated every second.








There is no autotest and no automarking of this question.

<p>
You can run <b>give</b> multiple times.
Only your last submission will be marked.
</p><p>
Don't submit any exercises you haven't attempted.
</p><p>
If you are working at home, you may find it more convenient
to upload your work via
 <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/code/login.php?app=/~give/Student/give.php&amp;debug=get_authuser">give's web interface</a>.
</p><p>
Remember you have until

<b>Tuesday 30 July 17:59:59</b>


to submit your work.
</p><p>
You cannot obtain marks by e-mailing lab work to tutors or lecturers.
</p><p>
You check the files you have submitted <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/19T2/student/">here</a>
</p><p>
Automarking will be run by the lecturer several days after the submission deadline
for the test, using test cases that you haven't seen:
different to the test cases <code><kbd>autotest</kbd></code> runs for
you.
</p><p>
(Hint: do your own testing as well as running
<code><kbd>autotest</kbd></code>)
</p><p>
After automarking is run by the lecturer you can
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/19T2/student/">view it here</a>
the resulting mark will also be available via
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/sturec.php">via give's web interface</a>
</p><p>
</p><h4>Lab Marks</h4>
<p>
When all components of a lab  are automarked you should be able to view the
the marks <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/sturec.php">via give's web interface</a>
or by running this command on a CSE machine:

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">2041 classrun -sturec</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
The lab exercises for each week are worth in total 1.2 marks.
</p><p>
Usually each lab exercise will be worth the same - for example if there are 5 lab exercises each will be worth 0.4 marks.
</p><p>
Except challenge exercises (see below) will never total more than 20% of each week's lab mark.
</p><p>
All of your lab marks for weeks 1-10, will be summed to give you a mark out of 12.
</p><p>
If their sum exceeds 9 - your total mark will be capped at 9.

</p><h4>Running Autotests On your Own Computer</h4>

An experimental version of autotest exists which may allow you to run autotest on your own computer.
<p>
If you are running Linux,  Windows Subsystem for Linux or OSX.  These commands might let you run autotests at home.

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">sudo wget https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/19T2/resources/home_autotest -O/usr/local/bin/2041_autotest</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/2041_autotest</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">2041_autotest shell_snapshot</kbd>
</pre>

Autotest itself needs Python 3.6 (or later) installed.
<p>
Particular autotests may require other software install, e.g.  autotests of perl programs require Perl installed (of course).
</p><p>
