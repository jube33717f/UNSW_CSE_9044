<h3 class="card-title">
                Sort Words Line by Line
            </h3>
</div>
<div class="card-body">










Write a Perl program <b>sort_words.pl</b> that reads lines of text from its standard input
and prints them to its standard output with the words on each line rearranged to be in sorted (alphabetic) order.
<p>
You can assume that a word is any sequence of non-whitespace characters.
</p><p>
You should print the words separated by a single space character.
</p><p>
For example:


    
        
    





</p><pre class="command_line" style="max-height: 32em;overflow:  auto;"><kbd class="shell">./sort_words.pl</kbd>
<kbd>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere     ages and ages hence

</pre>

Your answer must be Perl only.  You can not use other languages such as Shell, Python or C.
<p>
You may not run external programs, e.g. via system or backquotes.
</p><p>
You can assume your input is ASCII.
</p><p>
No error checking is necessary.





</p><p>
When you think your program is working you can  <code>autotest</code> to run some simple automated tests:

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">2041 autotest sort_words</kbd>
</pre>


















When you are finished working  on this exercise you must submit
your work by running <b>give</b>:

<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">give cs2041 test05_sort_words sort_words.pl</kbd>
</pre>

<h3 class="card-title">
                Replace the digits in A File 
            </h3>
</div>
<div class="card-body">










Write a Perl program <code>replace_digits.pl</code> that take a single argument a filename.
<p>
It should replace all digits (0-9 characters) in the files with the character '#'.
</p><p>
Your program should not should produce any output.
</p><p>
Your program should only change the file.
</p><p>
For example

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">cat file.txt</kbd>
I can think of 100's, no 1000,000s
of other things I'd rather
be doing than these 3 questions.
<kbd class="shell">./replace_digits.pl file.txt</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">cat file.txt</kbd>
I can think of ###'s, no ####,###s
of other things I'd rather
be doing than these # questions.
</pre>
<b>Hint</b>: don't try read and writing the file at the same time - it won't work - read all all the file, then write the file.
<p>
Your answer must be Perl only.  You can not use other languages such as Shell, Python or C.
</p><p>
You may not run external programs, e.g. via system or backquotes.
</p><p>
You can assume the file contains ASCII and is less than 1 megabyte.
</p><p>
No error checking is necessary.

When you think your program is working you can  <code>autotest</code> to run some simple automated tests:

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">2041 autotest replace_digits</kbd>
</pre>


















When you are finished working  on this exercise you must submit
your work by running <b>give</b>:

<h3 class="card-title">
                Test if Files are Identical
            </h3>
</div>
<div class="card-body">









Write a Perl program, <b>identical_files.pl</b> which takes 2 or more filenames are argument.
<p>
Your program should then check if each file has exactly the same contents ad
the other files given as arguments.
</p><p>
If all files are identical (the same), it should print exactly the message in the example below.
</p><p>
Otherwise it should print a message indicating the first file which is different
to a previous file on the command line.
Again print exactly the message as in the example below.
</p><p>
For example if create some files for testing:

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">seq 40 42 &gt;fortytwo.txt</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">cat fortytwo.txt</kbd>
40
41
42
<kbd class="shell">cp fortytwo.txt 42.txt</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">cp fortytwo.txt 42a.txt</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">seq 1 5 &gt;five.txt</kbd>
<kbd class="shell">cat five.txt</kbd>
1
2
3
4
5
<kbd class="shell">cp five.txt 5.txt</kbd>
</pre>

Then this is how <b>identical_files.pl</b> should behave:


    
        
    





<pre class="command_line" style="max-height: 32em;overflow:  auto;"><kbd class="shell">./identical_files.pl five.txt 5.txt</kbd>
All files are identical
<kbd class="shell">./identical_files.pl fortytwo.txt 42.txt 42a.txt</kbd>
All files are identical
<kbd class="shell">./identical_files.pl 5.txt 42.txt 42a.txt five.text</kbd>
42.txt is not identical
<kbd class="shell">./identical_files.pl</kbd>
Usage: ./identical_files.pl &lt;files&gt;
</pre>

Your answer must be Perl only.  You can not use other languages such as Shell, Python or C.

                Submission
            </h3>
</div>
<div class="card-body">


When you are finished each exercise make sure you submit your work by running <b>give</b>.
<p>
You can run <b>give</b> multiple times.
Only your last submission will be marked.
</p><p>
Don't submit any exercises you haven't attempted.
</p><p>
If you are working at home, you may find it more convenient
to upload your work via
 <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/code/login.php?app=/~give/Student/give.php&amp;debug=get_authuser">give's web interface</a>.
</p><p>

Remember you have until
<b>Tuesday 16 July 21:59:59</b>
to complete this test.
</p><p>
Automarking will be run by the lecturer several days after the submission deadline
for the test, using test cases that you haven't seen:
different to the test cases <code><kbd>autotest</kbd></code> runs for
you.
</p><p>
(Hint: do your own testing as well as running
<code><kbd>autotest</kbd></code>)
</p><p>
After automarking is run by the lecturer you can
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/19T2/student/">view it here</a>
the resulting mark will also be available via
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~give/Student/sturec.php">via give's web interface</a>
</p><p>
</p></div>
</div>



The test exercises for each week are worth in total 1 mark.
<p>
The best 6 of your 8 test marks for weeks 3-10 will be summed to give you a mark out of 6.
